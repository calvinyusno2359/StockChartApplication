Package
Modules
Modules are files containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
Modules are useful because they can store a handy function that you may need to use often into it. You can then call the function from the module whenever you need it.

In python, there is a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script. These files are known as modules. Definitions and functions in a module can be imported into other modules.

To create a module, you would need to save a code into a file with the suffix `.py` appended.

A docstring is a string literal that usually appears as the first statement in a module. It is used to explain what the module does. The docstring becomes a __doc__ special attribute of that object.
There are several built-in modules in python which can be imported and called at any time.

Example: 

import platform

x = platform.system()
print(x)

You can also use the `dir()` function to list all the defined names belonging to the platform module.

Example:

import platform

x = dir(platform)
print(x)
